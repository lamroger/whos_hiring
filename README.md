# Who's Hiring

This is created to give a better view into the monthly Who's Hiring threads on Hacker News.

The focus of this project is to provide developers the tools to optimize their job search. 

## Setup

We use Rails 5 and Ruby 2.3.1. We recommend using rbenv to manage the ruby version on your local environment.
